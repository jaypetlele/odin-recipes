        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul> 
            <li>100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</li>
            <li>1 Â¾ pounds ground pork</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage in a large bowl. Stir until well mixed.</li>
            <li>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.</li>
            <li>Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking together; steam until pork is cooked through, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
