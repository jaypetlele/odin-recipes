This is a repository for my first TOP assignment

In this assignment I am going to create a recipe website.

Here are some thoughs from completing this assignment:
It's easy to make mistakes
Do more "section" commits than "single action" commits
Write down actions on a paper or sticky note to keep track of changes
Don't complicate thing but pay attention to detail
always test before commiting
